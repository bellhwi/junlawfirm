            </p>
            <p>
              Attorney Jun is licensed to practice law in the states of Illinois
              and Indiana. He's been practicing various aspects of immigration
              law since 2005. Having personally gone through the U.S.
              immigration process to become a lawful permanent resident, he
              deeply understands the needs, dreams, and goals of his clients as
              they pursue success in the United States.

            <p>
              Attorney Jun has assisted a diverse range of immigrant and foreign
              national groups with various objectives, including investors,

              Notably, he has volunteered his time, knowledge, and experience as
              an attorney for numerous foreign student groups across the
              Midwest, including Korean Student Associations at the University
              of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), Ohio State University
              (OSU), University of Wisconsin, Cincinnati University, Indiana
              University at Bloomington (IUB), Purdue University, and the

            <p>
              Attorney Jun has conducted various seminars at different venues
              upon request, covering topics such as changes in immigration laws
