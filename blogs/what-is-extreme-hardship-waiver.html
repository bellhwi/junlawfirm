                Extreme hardship is a legal term used in the context of U.S.
                immigration law. It refers to the standard of proof that must be
                met in order for certain types of non-citizens to be eligible
                for certain types of relief from removal or deportation, such as
                cancellation of removal or waiver of inadmissibility.
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                To qualify for relief based on extreme hardship, an individual
                must show that his or her removal from the United States would
                cause extreme hardship to a qualifying relative, who is
                typically a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse,
                parent, or child. The individual must demonstrate that the
                hardship would go beyond the normal hardship that would be
                expected if the individual were removed from the United States,
                and would instead be extreme.

                In determining whether extreme hardship exists, immigration
                authorities consider a wide range of factors, including but not
                limited to:
              </div>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-8 pb-8 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  The nature and extent of the hardship that the qualifying
                  relative would suffer if the non-citizen were removed from the
                  United States.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The non-citizen’s length of residence in the United States, as
                  well as his or her ties to the community, including family,
                  employment, and other relationships.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The non-citizen’s own health and medical conditions, as well
                  as those of his or her qualifying relative
                </li>
                <li>
                  The financial impact of the non-citizen’s removal on the
                  qualifying relative and his or her ability to earn a
                  livelihood.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The conditions in the country to which the non-citizen would
                  be removed, including economic, social, and political factors.

                It is important to note that extreme hardship is a high standard
                to meet, and each case is evaluated on an individual basis. If
                you are considering seeking relief based on extreme hardship, it
                is advisable to consult with an experienced immigration attorney
                to discuss the specifics of your case and assess your chances of
                success.
