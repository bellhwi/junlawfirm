                The current pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has
                been determined by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a
                public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under
                the International Health Regulations. COVID-19 meets the
                definition of a quarantinable communicable disease under 42 USC
                264 and Executive Order 13295, as amended by Executive Order
                13375 and 13674. Specifically, COVID-19 meets the definition of
                severe acute respiratory syndromes as specified by Presidential
                Executive Order 13674external icon (issued July 31, 2014), thus
                making it a Class A Inadmissible Condition.

                non-immigrants (NIVs) who are required to have an overseas
                medical examination, are medically screened days or weeks prior
                to travel to the United States (US). Thus, a negative screening
                for COVID-19 at the time of the medical evaluation does not
                guarantee the applicant will not have COVID-19 at the time of
                immigration to the United States.

                recommended COVID-19 vaccination for the age-appropriate,
                general US population. Therefore, COVID-19 vaccination now meets
                the criteria for required vaccinations and is a requirement for
                applicants.

                The COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in these Technical
                Instructions, hereinafter referred to as “approved COVID-19
                vaccines,” are those vaccines authorized for emergency use (EUA)
                by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)external icon or
                listed for emergency use (EUL) by the World Health Organization
                (WHO) (see “Status of COVID-19 Vaccines within WHO EUL/PQ
                evaluation process”).external icon If an FDA EUA vaccine becomes
                licensed for use in the United States, it will continue to be an
                approved COVID-19 vaccine. If an approved COVID-19 vaccine is
                available to the applicant in the country where the examination
                occurs, the applicant must complete the vaccine series and
                provide documentation to the panel physician in person before
                completion of the medical examination.
