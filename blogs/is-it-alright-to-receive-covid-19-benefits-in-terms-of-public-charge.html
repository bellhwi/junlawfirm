                USCIS has officially issued a memorandum to eliminate the
                ambiguity surrounding Public Charge Rule and Covid-19 benefits.
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                Q2: What about other COVID-19 public benefits, such as for food,
                housing, cash assistance, rental assistance, tax credits,
                stimulus payments, unemployment, financial aid grants to
                students, Paycheck Protection Program, and student loan
                forbearance? *
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                A2: We do not consider public benefits specifically related to
                COVID-19 because they generally fall under either noncash
                benefits or special-purpose cash benefits not considered under
                the 1999 Interim Field Guidance. We consider only those benefits
                listed in the 1999 Interim Field Guidance, such as cash
                assistance for income maintenance (for example, SSI and TANF)
                and General Assistance (in other words, cash assistance provided
                by states or localities), as well long-term institutionalization
                provided at a governmentâ€™s expense.
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                The 1999 Interim Field Guidance acknowledges that states have
                flexibility in administering the TANF program and may choose to
                provide noncash assistance such as subsidized childcare or
                transportation vouchers in addition to cash assistance. It
                indicates that such noncash benefits should not be considered
                for public charge purposes. It also indicates that states may
                also provide nonrecurrent cash payments for specific crisis
                situations under TANF. These payments should not be considered
                for public charge purposes under the 1999 Interim Field Guidance
                because they are not cash for income maintenance.
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                While the 1999 Interim Field Guidance does not provide a
                comprehensive list of benefits that we do not consider, cash
                assistance related to COVID-19 is like disaster assistance or
                crisis-based cash TANF, and therefore, we consider such is
                special-purpose cash assistance that is not cash assistance for
                income maintenance. Therefore, we do not consider it in public
                charge determinations. Also, under the 1999 Interim Field
                Guidance, we do not consider noncash benefits (except those
                supporting noncitizens receiving long-term institutional care).
                Therefore, we do not consider COVID-19 related food/nutrition
                assistance, housing assistance, tax credits, student loan
                forbearance, and the like, in making a public charge
                inadmissibility determination.
