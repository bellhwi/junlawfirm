              <div class="pb-8">
                The USCIS Parole Program for International Entrepreneurs is a
                program designed to allow foreign entrepreneurs to temporarily
                enter and remain in the United States to develop and grow
                startup businesses. The program was established to help attract
                foreign entrepreneurs to the United States, and to create new
                jobs and stimulate economic growth. Under the program,
                entrepreneurs who meet certain eligibility requirements can be
                granted “parole” status, which allows them to stay in the United
                States for up to five years to develop and grow their business.
                The program is designed to encourage foreign entrepreneurs to
                invest in the United States, while also providing benefits to
                the US economy.

              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                the eligibility requirements for the USCIS Parole Program for
                International Entrepreneurs:
              </div>
              <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 pb-8 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  Ownership: The entrepreneur must own at least 10% of the
                  startup at the time of application. This means that the
                  entrepreneur must have a significant role in the startup and
                  must be actively involved in its management.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Formation: The startup must have been formed within the past
                  five years. This means that the startup must have been created
                  no earlier than five years before the date of the parole
                  application.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Funding: The startup must have received at least $250,000 in
                  qualifying investments from one or more qualified US
                  investors, or at least $100,000 in grants or awards from
                  government entities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Role in the company: The entrepreneur must have a central and
                  active role in the startup’s operations, and must be
                  well-positioned to grow and develop the startup.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Growth potential: The startup must have significant potential
                  for rapid growth and job creation, and must be able to show
                  how it will contribute to the US economy.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <div class="pb-8">
                It’s important to note that meeting the above criteria does not
                guarantee approval for the program. The USCIS will review each
                application on a case-by-case basis to determine if the
                entrepreneur and the startup meet the program’s eligibility
                requirements.

                <div class="vl"></div>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2">BENEFITS</h3>
              </div>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-8 pb-8 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  Ability to stay in the United States: One of the primary
                  benefits of the program is that it allows foreign
                  entrepreneurs to stay in the United States for up to five
                  years to develop and grow their startup. This provides
                  entrepreneurs with the time they need to build their business
                  and establish a presence in the US market.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Work authorization: Parolees under this program are authorized
                  to work for the startup, which means they can be paid a salary
                  and receive other compensation. This can help entrepreneurs
                  fund the startup’s operations and ensure its growth and
                  development.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Opportunity to bring family members: Entrepreneurs who are
                  granted parole status under the program are also able to bring
                  their spouses and children with them to the United States.
                  This allows the entrepreneur to maintain a stable family life
                  while they work on building their business.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Access to resources: Parolees under the program are able to
                  access a range of resources to help them build and grow their
                  business. This includes access to mentorship, networking
                  opportunities, and other resources provided by incubators and
                  accelerators.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Path to permanent residency: While the program does not
                  provide a direct path to permanent residency, parolees under
                  the program may be eligible for other forms of immigration
                  benefits, such as the EB-5 program, which provides a path to
                  permanent residency for those who invest a certain amount of
                  money in a US business.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <div class="pb-8">
                Overall, the program provides a valuable opportunity for foreign
                entrepreneurs to establish and grow their business in the United
                States, while also contributing to the US economy and job
                market.

                <li>
                  Form I-941: The first step in the application process is to
                  complete Form I-941, which is the Application for Entrepreneur
                  Parole. This form requires information about the entrepreneur,
                  the startup, and the entrepreneur’s business activities in the
                  United States.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Supporting documents: In addition to Form I-941, applicants
                  are required to submit a range of supporting documents to
                  demonstrate their eligibility for the program. These documents
                  may include:
                </li>
                <li>
                  Evidence of ownership: This can include articles of
                  incorporation, stock certificates, and other documents showing
                  that the entrepreneur owns at least 10% of the startup.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Evidence of business activities: This can include business
                  plans, financial statements, and other documents demonstrating
                  the startup’s potential for rapid growth and job creation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Evidence of the entrepreneur’s role in the startup: This can
                  include resumes, job descriptions, and other documents showing
                  that the entrepreneur has a central and active role in the
                  startup’s operations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Filing the application: Once the application and supporting
                  documents are complete, they must be filed with the USCIS.
                  There is a filing fee associated with the application, which
                  must be paid at the time of filing.
                </li>

              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                The USCIS will review the application and supporting documents
                to determine if the entrepreneur and the startup meet the
                program’s eligibility requirements. If approved, the
                entrepreneur will be granted parole status and will be able to
                enter and remain in the United States to develop and grow their
                startup. If the application is denied, the entrepreneur may have
                the opportunity to appeal the decision.

                It’s important to note that the application process can be
                complex, and it’s recommended that entrepreneurs seek the
                assistance of an experienced immigration attorney to help them
                navigate the process and ensure the best possible chance of
                success.
