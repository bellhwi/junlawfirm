              If my request for Keeping Families Together is approved, will I
              accrue unlawful presence?
            </h3>

            <p>
              A. No. If you are granted parole in place under Keeping Families
              Together, you are in a period of authorized stay, which means you
              do not accrue unlawful presence while your parole remains valid
              (that is, not expired or terminated). Importantly, however, if you
              receive parole in place under Keeping Families Together, it does
              not erase any unlawful presence accrued <em>before</em> the start
              of your parole period. Furthermore, a pending request for parole
              in place does not stop the accrual of unlawful presence.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your parole expires or is otherwise terminated, you will begin
              accruing unlawful presence unless you are maintaining or obtain
              another status during the parole period. Parole may be terminated
              at any time in DHS’s discretion upon a determination that parole
              is no longer warranted, for example, following the commission of
              criminal conduct. It is recommended that you apply for lawful
              permanent resident status as soon as possible after obtaining
              parole in place under this process. For more information on
              applying for lawful permanent resident status.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <h3>
              I was lawfully admitted to the United States on a nonimmigrant
              visa but overstayed my period of authorized stay. Am I eligible
              for parole in place under the process?
            </h3>

            <p>
              A. No. By law, parole is only available to noncitizens who are
              “applicants for admission” under Section 235(a) of the INA, 8
              U.S.C. § 1225(a). Therefore, parole in place under this process
              may be granted only to certain individuals who are present in the
              United States without admission. This process is not available to
              those who were previously lawfully admitted to the United States.
              However, an individual may be eligible to apply for adjustment of
              status to that of lawful permanent resident (LPR) without parole
              in place if previously lawfully admitted and applying as an
              immediate relative of a U.S. citizen.
            </p>
            <h3>
              If I am in removal proceedings that are pending before an
              immigration judge, am I eligible for this process? Who will decide
              my parole application?
            </h3>

            <p>
              A. Noncitizens in removal proceedings may apply for parole in
              place under this process before USCIS if they otherwise qualify
              under this process. USCIS will weigh, on a case-by-case basis, the
              existence and circumstances of the removal proceedings, as well as
              the applicant’s positive equities, in determining whether to grant
              parole in place. However, a noncitizen who is in removal
              proceedings because they are an enforcement priority under the
              <em>Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law</em>,
              issued by Secretary Mayorkas in September 2021, will be
              disqualified from receiving parole in place pursuant to this
              process.
            </p>
            <h3>
              If my parole request is pending and I am encountered by CBP or
              ICE, will I be placed into removal proceedings?
            </h3>

            <p>
              A. The
              <em>Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law </em
              >direct the Department to focus its limited resources on
              noncitizens who pose a threat to our national security, public
              safety, or border security. The <em>Guidelines </em>remain in
              effect. An application under this process does not prevent CBP or
              ICE from taking enforcement action against an individual when
              otherwise appropriate under applicable law and policy. CBP and ICE
              reserve the discretion to place these noncitizens in removal
              proceedings.
            </p>
            <h3>
              If USCIS denies my application for parole, will I be placed in
              removal proceedings?
            </h3>

            <p>
              A. If USCIS denies a request for parole, USCIS maintains
              discretion to issue a Notice to Appear (NTA) or refer the case to
              ICE for possible enforcement action consistent with the
              <em>Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law</em>
              issued by Secretary Mayorkas on Sept. 30, 2021.
            </p>
            <h3>
              If I have criminal history, can I apply for parole under this
              process?
            </h3>

            <p>
              A. All applicants will undergo national security and public safety
              vetting as part of this process. Those who pose a threat to
              national security or public safety will be disqualified from this
              process and, where appropriate, may be referred for law
              enforcement action. Noncitizens who pose a threat to national
              security or public safety will not be eligible for this process,
              as aligned with our immigration enforcement priorities. If a
              noncitizen poses a threat to national security or public safety,
              DHS will detain, remove, or refer them to other federal agencies
              for further vetting, investigation, or prosecution as appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Disqualifying criminal history includes criminal convictions that
              are likely to render the individual statutorily ineligible for
              adjustment of status, as well as convictions that do not render
              noncitizens statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status but
              nevertheless warrant their disqualification from this process in
              the exercise of discretion. Further guidance on this topic is
              forthcoming.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Can the undocumented child of a noncitizen spouse covered by this
              policy also be considered for a grant of parole in place under the
              process?
            </h3>

            <p>
              A. Noncitizen children of potential requestors may be considered
              for parole in place under this process along with their noncitizen
              parent, if the child is physically present in the United States
              without admission or parole as of June 17, 2024, and has a
              qualifying stepchild relationship to a U.S. citizen as of that
              date. To qualify as a stepchild under the Immigration and
              Nationality Act, the noncitizen child must be unmarried, under the
              age of 21, and the marriage of their noncitizen parent and U.S.
              citizen stepparent must have taken place prior to the child’s 18th
              birthday. Further guidance on this topic is forthcoming.

            <h2><em>Employment Authorization</em></h2>
            <h3>
              If I am approved for parole, when can I apply for an employment
              authorization document (EAD)? Can I apply for an EAD at the same

            </h3>

            <p>
              An individual who is granted parole is immediately eligible to
