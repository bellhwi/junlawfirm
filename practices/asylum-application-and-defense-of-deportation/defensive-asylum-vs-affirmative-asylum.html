                Defensive asylum and affirmative asylum are two distinct
                processes for applying for asylum in the United States. The
                primary difference between the two lies in when and where the
                asylum application is made and the associated legal proceedings.
                Here's a breakdown of the key differences:
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8 text-lg font-bold">Affirmative Asylum:</div>
              <ul class="pl-8 list-decimal pb-8 space-y-4">
                <li>
                  <strong>Timing</strong>: Affirmative asylum is the process for
                  individuals who are not in removal proceedings. It's typically
                  used by people who arrive in the United States and proactively
                  apply for asylum within one year of their entry or arrival.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Application Venue</strong>: Asylum seekers submit
                  their applications with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
                  Services (USCIS), which is a part of the Department of
                  Homeland Security (DHS).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Interview</strong>: After the application is
                  submitted, the applicant will be scheduled for an asylum
                  interview with a USCIS asylum officer. During the interview,
                  the applicant presents their case and provides supporting
                  evidence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Decision</strong>: The asylum officer will determine
                  whether the applicant is eligible for asylum. If granted, the
                  applicant is allowed to stay in the United States as an
                  asylee.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Appeal</strong>: If the asylum application is denied,
                  the case may be referred to immigration court for removal
                  proceedings, and the applicant can continue to seek asylum as
                  a defense against deportation.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <div class="pb-8 text-lg font-bold">Defensive Asylum:</div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                Defensive asylum is a type of asylum application in the United
                States that occurs when an individual seeks asylum as a defense
                against removal (deportation) from the country. Here’s an
                overview of the defensive asylum application procedure:
              </div>
              <ul class="pl-8 list-decimal pb-8 space-y-4">
                <li>
                  <strong>Initiation of Removal Proceedings </strong>:
                  <p>
                    Defensive asylum cases begin when the U.S. government
                    initiates removal proceedings against an individual. This
                    typically happens if the person is apprehended by
                    immigration authorities or if they were already in removal
                    proceedings for another reason and decided to seek asylum as
                    a defense.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Filing the Asylum Application </strong>:
                  <p>
                    The individual must submit Form I-589, Application for
                    Asylum and for Withholding of Removal, to the immigration
                    court handling their case. This form is used to apply for
                    asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the
                    Convention Against Torture (CAT).
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Immigration Court Hearings</strong>:
                  <p>
                    The case will be heard by an Immigration Judge (IJ) in an
                    immigration court. There are several types of hearings that
                    may occur:
                  </p>
                  <ul class="ml-4 list-disc">
                    <li>
                      <strong>Master Calendar Hearing </strong>: An initial,
                      brief hearing where procedural matters are addressed. The
                      applicant confirms their intention to apply for asylum,
                      and future hearing dates are set.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Individual Hearing </strong>: A longer, more
                      detailed hearing where the applicant presents their case
                      for asylum. This includes testimony, submission of
                      evidence, and arguments from the applicant’s attorney (if
                      they have one) and the government’s attorney.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Testimony and Evidence </strong>:
                  <ul class="ml-4 list-disc">
                    <li>
                      During the individual hearing, the applicant must
                      demonstrate that they meet the definition of a refugee,
                      showing that they have a well-founded fear of persecution
                      in their home country based on race, religion,
                      nationality, membership in a particular social group, or
                      political opinion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The applicant can provide testimony, submit documents, and
                      present witnesses to support their claim. The government
                      attorney can cross-examine the applicant and present
                      evidence against the claim.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Decision by the Immigration Judge </strong>:
                  <p>
                    After considering all the evidence and arguments, the
                    Immigration Judge will issue a decision. If the judge grants
                    asylum, the applicant can stay in the U.S. and eventually
                    apply for a green card. If the judge denies asylum, the
                    applicant may be ordered removed from the U.S.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Appeal Process </strong>:
                  <ul class="ml-4 list-disc">
                    <li>
                      If asylum is denied, the applicant can appeal the decision
                      to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). If the BIA
                      upholds the denial, the applicant can further appeal to
                      the federal courts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      During the appeal process, the applicant may remain in the
                      U.S. until a final decision is made.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                      If granted asylum, the individual is allowed to remain in
                      the U.S., obtain employment authorization, and eventually
                      apply for lawful permanent resident status.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If denied and all appeals are exhausted, the individual
                      may be deported from the U.S.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                The defensive asylum process is complex and involves legal
                representation, substantial documentation, and significant
                preparation for court hearings. Applicants are encouraged to
                seek assistance from experienced immigration attorneys or
                accredited representatives.
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                In summary, the key difference between affirmative and defensive
                asylum is the timing and venue of the application. Affirmative
                asylum is for those who proactively apply for asylum with USCIS
                before entering removal proceedings, while defensive asylum is
                for those who apply for asylum as a defense against deportation
                in immigration court after they are already in removal
                proceedings. The legal standards for asylum eligibility are the
                same in both processes, but the procedures and the government
                agencies involved differ.
