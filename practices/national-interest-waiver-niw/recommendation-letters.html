                Successful recommendation letters should contain detailed
                information discussing your research contributions and their
                significances. Also, it should mention on why he/she think it
                would be beneficial for the U.S to grant him/her Permanent
                Residency. Thus, it should be written by the experts in the same
                field with yours who knows you well as a professional worker.
                Independent experts rather than your internal co-workers are
                always in better position in terms of writing recommendation
                letters which convince USCIS more of your expertise.

              <div class="pb-8">
                A well-written recommendation letter is one of the foundational
                pieces of evidence that can support a waiver of the labor
                certification requirement of an NIW application. While objective
                evidence states facts about the applicant, a recommendation
                letter can shine light on the applicant’s skills from a more
                personal perspective. In fact, multiple recommendation letters
                may significantly bolster an NIW application. That is why
                substantial effort should be made to ensure that persuasive and
                well-written recommendation letters are submitted as evidence.

              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                According to the USCIS Policy Guide, recommendation letters
                should be written by experts in the applicant’s field of study.
                The person chosen to write the letter must be able to adequately
                evaluate and reflect on the applicant’s past and future
                contributions to the field. Finding a recommender who has
                published significant works or who has a strong national or
                international reputation is helpful. If necessary to illustrate
                the expert’s status, the applicant may submit additional
                evidence supporting the expert’s position in the field.
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                In addition, letters written by experts who are personally
                acquainted with the applicant will be more valuable to the USCIS
                officer reviewing the case. Consider requesting a letter from
                professors or advisors who have a direct connection to the
                applicant’s work for a sincere and detailed recommendation
                letter.

                The essential purpose of a National Interest Waiver is to show
                that (1) the applicant’s work is of national importance (2) and
                substantial merit, and (3) that the applicant is in a position
                to complete the work. A recommendation letter should speak to
                this purpose by clearly highlighting the reasons why the
                applicant’s work is important and of merit. To achieve this
                goal, the recommender should state the reasons for each
                confidently and give multiple detailed examples to support each
                point. Using persuasive and descriptive language to explain the
                examples will also form a better impression on the reader as
                well. A more detailed and passionate letter will be more

                  Opinion about the applicant’s authorship of scholarly articles
                  in the field, published material, presentations, awards,
                  grants, and other achievement.

                  Opinion about whether, even assuming that other qualified U.S
                  workers are available, the US would still benefit from the
                  foreign national’s contribution.

                Additionally, as the recommender likely has a personal
                connection to the applicant, the recommender can explain more
                vividly why the applicant is at the top of his or her field.
                Explaining why the applicant stands out from others in the field
                will show why the applicant should be granted a waiver. Listing
                the achievements and awards granted to the applicant from a
                personal perspective may be persuasive. Also, referring to the
                future impact of the waiver on the applicant’s research can
                convince the reader that the applicant’s work has true
                potential.

                Ultimately, anyone who reads the letter should easily understand
                why the applicant must be granted a waiver to further the
                national interest of the United States, and further the work
                that the applicant is attempting to complete.
