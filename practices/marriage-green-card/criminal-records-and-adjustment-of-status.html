                8 USC 1182 stipulates inadmissible aliens and another code 8 USC
                1127 stipulates deportable aliens. When a foreign national
                applies for a lawful permanent residence, those elements
                enumerated in the codes affect the applicant’s eligibility for
                green card application. According to INA Section 245 (a), any
                applicant for Adjustment of Status shall not be inadmissible or
                deportable for any reasons as set forth in those codes.
                Therefore, if an AOS applicant has been arrested or convicted of
                any criminal activity, screening whether the crime falls on any
                of those criminal grounds for inadmissibility or deportation is
                very important. A few criminal activities among many others are
                explained hereunder for examples.

                Anyone who is seeking to adjust their status in the US shall be
                neither inadmissible nor deportable. Under section INA §237
                (a)(2)(A)(i), an foreign national or LPR is deportable if s/he
                is (1) convicted; (2) of a crime of moral turpitude; (3)
                committed within 5 years of admission; and is (4) convicted of a
                crime for which a sentence of one year or longer must be
                imposed.

                The phrase “crime of moral turpitude” is not defined in the
                Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) The Eighth Circuit
                explained that the phrase “moral turpitude” refers to conduct
                which is inherently base, vile, or depraved, and contrary to the
                accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons
                or to society in general.

              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                Entry is different from admission. The current law looks to
                whether the crime was committed within 5 years of admission, not
                entry. Admission is defined under INA §101(a)(13)(A).
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                The terms “admission” and “admitted” mean, with respect to an
                alien, the lawful entry of the alien into the United States
                after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                However, the definition under the statute is very ambiguous. At
                least one circuit has found that the unambiguous definition of
                admission under the statute means that the criminal act must
                occur within 5 years of the person’s lawful entry into the U.S
                and not within 5 years of his or her later adjustment of status.
                Thus admission under the statute is not defined as including
                Adjustment of Status but rather the prior lawful entry of the
                alien into the U.S. Shivaraman vs. Ashcroft. 360 F.3d 1142. (9

                Once a conviction exits, it is hard to erase or undo the
                conviction. Especially rehabilitative relief would not eliminate
                conviction for immigration purpose. In most states, state laws
                allow withdrawal of a plea or dismissal of charges because the
                defendant completed probation or other requirements, rather than
                because of some legal error. However, for immigration purpose,
                those relief would not work for erasing the conviction.
                Expungement of criminal records are lined with rehabilitative
                relieves for the same purpose.

                As of January 1, 2018, state of California created pretrial

                Therefore, deposition of a case would be rendered no conviction
                because there was no plea of guilty. However, State of Indiana
                is different. State of Indiana has pretrial diversion program
                too. But it requires Plea of Guilty as a prerequisite for the

                18 U.S.C §16 defines crime of violence as (a) “any offense that

                physical force against the person or property of another, or (b)

                must be such that the use, attempted use, or threatened use of

                crime -as evidenced by the generic elements of the offense- must
                be such that its commission ordinarily would present a risk that

                showing of negligence or less than intentional conduct. Leocal

                DUI (Driving Under Influence)
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                Usually a single DUI is not considered a crime of violence or
                moral turpitude because it lacks mens rea requirement. The US
                Supreme Court held in Leocal v.Ashcroft that DUI causing serious
                bodily injury under Florida law was not a COV because it require
                higher mens rea than the merely accidental or negligent conduct
                involved in a DUI offense”.

                DUI as a crime of moral turpitude.
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                Again, in most cases, a single DUI without incurring physical
                harm to others tends not to be a crime of turpitude. However, if
                there are some aggravating factors with the DUI charge, the DUI
                charge can be construed as a crime of moral turpitude even
                though the statute under which the foreigner is charged requires
                only recklessness for conviction.
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                For example, in Hernandez-Perez, the 8th Circuit observed that
                although the court recognized that a drunk driving offense on
                its own “almost certainly does not involve moral turpitude,” it
                concluded that the statute’s requirement that the defendant
                “create a grave risk of death to another person,” was an
                aggravating factor sufficient to find moral turpitude. The
                defendant in the case was charged with an aggravated felony for
                DUI and one count of child endangerment.

              <div class="pb-8">
                A single DUI conviction or more previous convictions would not
                automatically trigger adverse immigration consequences. However,
                multiple DUI convictions can contribute to finding a noncitizen
                a habitual drunkard, it could adversely function to fail to
                establish good moral character which is one requirement to prove
                in applying for US citizenship. Also, it could be considered as
                inadmissible for a health-related issue – mental or physical
                disorder. Therefore, it is important to prove that the applicant

                Domestic Battery / Battery
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                INA §237(a)(2)(E) set forth domestic violence as a deportable
                crime. It also sets out four bases for deportation relating to a
                domestic violence charge: conviction of a crime of domestic
                violence, a crime of stalking, or a crime of child abuse,
                neglect, or abandonment of, or being the subject of a judicial
                finding of violation of domestic violence stay-away order.
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                To be deportable for domestic violence under INA
                §237(a)(2)(E)(i), the person must be convicted for the crime and
                have qualifying domestic relationship to the victim. Here, it is
                noteworthy that the crime must be a crime of violence.
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                In the first place, 18 USC §16(a) defines crime of violence as
                “an offense that has an element the use, attempted use or
                threatened use of physical force against the person or property
                of another” Later, US Supreme Court in Sessions v. Dimaya, 138
                S.Ct.1204 (2018) held that this definition is
                “unconstitutionally vague.” Under Dimaya, the code was revised
                accordingly and it’s current definition is;
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                18 USC §16 (a), the term of Crime of Violence
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                – An offense that has as an element the use, attempted use or
                threatened use of physical force against the person or property
                of another.
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                The interpretation of “force” can vary with jurisdiction.
                However, generally “force” here means violent, aggressive,
                intentional force. Court have interpreted §16(a) to exclude
                offenses that can be violated by an offensive touching,
                negligent conduct, DUI or DUI with injury, absent a special
                intent requirement and recklessness.
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                Under the new definition of crime of violence in Dimaya which is
                retroactively applicable, those who were prohibited from
                applying for Adjustment of Status or Naturalization for domestic
                violence can have different analysis than otherwise. Even those
                who were already placed in removal proceeding for the same
                conviction could file motion to reopen or reconsideration for
                the orders against them.

                Following Dimaya, US Supreme Court in Stokeling vs. US (2019)
                that “if overcoming the will of the victim is an element of the
                offense, even a de minimis use of force, often called an
                “offensive touch” amounts to a Crime of Violence.
