                  Marriage on Tourist Visa / ESTA (Visa Waiver Program) and
                  Adjustment of Status
                </h3>
              </div>
              <div class="py-8 font-semibold text-lg">
                Is it possible to apply for a Lawful Permanent Residence (so
                called “Green Card”) after I entered the US on a tourist visa?
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                That’s very tricky question because a visitor visa is not
                supposed to be an alternative way to enter the US with intent to
                get married to a US citizen and apply for a green card.
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                For this reason, USCIS always emphasizes that you utilize K1
                visa or consular processing for your green card application.
                However, once you are physically present in the US after
                inspection at the port of entry without the intent for marrying,
                you are allowed to apply for a green card through Adjustment of
                Status (INA§ 245 (a)) if other conditions are met. The standard
                point of the time to determine whether you had such intent or
                not is the time when you entered the US. Thus, if you changed
                mind later after having entered the US and got married to a US
                citizen, it is permissible act to apply for LPR through AOS
                under the Immigration and Naturalization Act.
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                Alternatively, what else way can I take to apply for a Green
                Card?
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                You can apply for a Fiance Visa (K1) if you are not married yet
                or utilize

              </div>
              <div class="py-8 font-semibold text-lg">
                Q1. I entered the US on ESTA (Visa Waiver Program, also commonly
                known as “No Visa”), can I apply for my Green Card though my
                marriage to a US citizen spouse?
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                Same as above-explained. However, it is not recommended even
                though it is possible and permissible under the law. Especially
                taking it both into account that you can stay in the US only for
                90 days on ESTA and that you cannot do anything running afoul of
                the purpose of your visa or visa waiver program during the first
                90 days (please refer to 90 days rule), applying for LPR after
                entering on ESTA could result in an undesirable situation down
                the road. However, once again, if you are already in the US and
                you did not have such intent when you entered the US, you would
                not have to get separated from your lovely family (spouse) just
                to complete the Green Card application. Please refer to
                Adjustment of Status application.
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">(Legal ground)</div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                According to the USCIS’s Policy Memo (PM-602-0093) issued on
                November 20, 2013, it clearly verified that “INA 245 (c)(4)
                renders aliens admitted under the VWP ineligible to adjust
                status to hat of a person admitted for permanent residence. This
                provision, however, includes an exception for immediate
                relatives of U.S citizens. Thus, an individual admitted under
                the VWP who is also an immediate relative is not precluded from
                seeking adjustment of status, even after the VWP period has
                expired.”
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                The memo further states that “US Immigration and Customs
                Enforcement (ICE) has authority to order the removal of a VWP
                overstay, including an immediate relative, under INA Section
                217(b) and 8 CFR 217.4(b). Numerous courts of appeals agree
                that, generally, a VWP overstay may not contest a removal action
                on the basis that he or she has filed Form I-485. However, these
                cases concern only the individual’s inability to contest
                removal…. Nor do these decisions preclude a VWP overstay who is
                not subject to a removal order from filing a Form I-485 with
                USCIS. Whether to grant adjustment to an eligible applicant is a
                matter entrusted to DHS discretion.”
              </div>
              <div class="py-8 font-semibold text-lg">
                Q2. My spouse is staying illegally in the US, is s/he still
                eligible to apply?
              </div>
              <div class="pb-8">
                Maybe yes, if s/he entered the U.S legitimately and other
                conditions are met. Immigration and Naturalization Act allows
                the out-of-status to apply for Adjustment of Status if they are
                Immediate Relative (spouse, children, parents) of a US citizen
                and entered the US legitimately for the first place.
