              As an Indiana immigration lawyer, my primary goal is to help
              individuals and families navigate the complex world of U.S.
              immigration laws. Whether it’s helping someone obtain a visa,
              assisting with family-based immigration, or securing a National
              Interest Waiver (NIW), I am deeply committed to advocating for
              immigrants. However, my role as an attorney extends beyond just
              immigration matters. I also provide legal services in other
              crucial areas, such as estate planning, which are essential to
              helping immigrants address the broader legal challenges they may
              face in daily life.

              Why Would You Need a Prenuptial Agreement for an International
              Marriage?
            </h2>
            <h3>A Focus on Estate Planning and Elective Shares</h3>
            <p>
              Marriage is a beautiful union that transcends borders and
              cultures, especially in international marriages. However, marriage
              is also a legal contract that carries significant financial and
              estate planning implications. One essential tool for protecting
              your interests, especially in international marriages, is a
              prenuptial agreement. This is particularly true when it comes to
              estate planning and restricting a surviving spouse’s elective
              share.
            </p>
            <h3>What is a Surviving Spouse’s Elective Share?</h3>
            <p>
              Under Indiana law, a surviving spouse has a statutory right to
              claim an "elective share" of their deceased spouse’s estate, even
              if the will provides for a different distribution. According to
              Indiana Code § 29-1-3-1, a surviving spouse may elect to take
              one-third of the deceased spouse's net estate instead of what was
              provided in the will or through intestate succession.
            </p>
            <p>
              The purpose of the elective share is to protect spouses from
              disinheritance. However, for international couples or those with
              complex estate plans, the elective share can disrupt intended
              asset distribution, especially when assets are meant to go to
              children from a previous marriage or are located in multiple
              jurisdictions.
            </p>
            <h3>Restricting the Elective Share with a Prenuptial Agreement</h3>
            <p>
              In Indiana, a prenuptial agreement can waive the surviving
              spouse’s right to the elective share, provided the agreement is
              valid and complies with state law. According to Indiana Code §
              29-1-3-7, a spouse’s elective share can be waived through a valid
              prenuptial agreement if both parties knowingly and voluntarily
              agree to it. This waiver must be explicitly stated in the
              prenuptial agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
              A well-drafted prenuptial agreement allows couples to plan their
              estates in a way that ensures the elective share does not
              interfere with their financial goals. This is especially important
              for international couples, who may own assets in different
              countries and wish to avoid unintended legal consequences that
              vary across jurisdictions.
            </p>
            <h3>Relevant Case Law: Validating the Waiver of Elective Share</h3>
            <p>
              The Indiana case In re Estate of Fisher, 798 N.E.2d 503 (Ind. Ct.
              App. 2003) provides important guidance on the enforceability of
              prenuptial agreements waiving the elective share. In this case,
              the court upheld the prenuptial agreement, which had waived the
              surviving spouse’s right to an elective share. The court
              emphasized that the agreement was valid because it was entered
              into voluntarily, both parties fully disclosed their financial
              circumstances, and there was no evidence of fraud or duress.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Fisher case demonstrates that Indiana courts will enforce a
              prenuptial agreement that clearly waives the right to an elective
              share, provided it meets the legal requirements of disclosure,
              fairness, and voluntariness.
            </p>
            <h3>Benefits of a Prenuptial Agreement in Estate Planning</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                For international couples, a prenuptial agreement is essential
                for ensuring that assets are distributed according to both
                parties' wishes, not by default state laws. Here’s how a
                prenuptial agreement can help in estate planning:
              </li>

              <li>
                Waiving the Elective Share: As outlined in Indiana Code and
                confirmed by case law, a prenuptial agreement can legally waive
                the surviving spouse’s right to an elective share, allowing the
                estate to be distributed according to the decedent’s wishes.
              </li>

              <li>
                Protecting International Assets: With assets in multiple
                countries, estate planning can be complex. A prenuptial
                agreement can specify how international assets will be treated,
                preventing potential conflicts between foreign and U.S. laws.
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Preserving Family Wealth: For individuals with children from
                  prior marriages or significant pre-marital assets, a
                  prenuptial agreement ensures that their wealth is protected
                  and distributed according to their plan.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                Avoiding Probate Battles: Clear provisions in a prenuptial
                agreement reduce the likelihood of disputes between the
                surviving spouse and other heirs, particularly if there are
                competing claims from multiple jurisdictions.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              In Indiana, as in many states, a prenuptial agreement is a
              powerful tool for estate planning, particularly when it comes to
              waiving the surviving spouse’s elective share. For international
              couples, a prenuptial agreement is crucial for managing assets
              across borders and ensuring that the estate is distributed
              according to their wishes. By citing the relevant Indiana statutes
              and case law, couples can be confident that their prenuptial
              agreement will hold up in court and protect their financial
              legacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working with an experienced attorney familiar with both Indiana
              and international estate law is essential for drafting a
              prenuptial agreement that addresses these complexities. With
              proper planning, you can protect your assets and ensure that your
              estate reflects your intentions for your spouse, children, and
              other beneficiaries.
