            Immigration Attorney in Indiana – National Interest Waiver (NIW)
            Denial Based on Exceptional Ability Without an Advanced Degree

            <h2>NIW/Degree Requirement/Exceptional Ability</h2>
            <p>
              This case, a non-precedent decision from the Administrative
              Appeals Office (AAO), highlights the challenges faced by
              petitioners seeking an EB-2 classification under the National
              Interest Waiver (NIW). In this case, the petitioner, working in
              the manufacturing industry, claimed exceptional ability to qualify
              for the waiver, as they did not hold an advanced degree. However,
              the petition was denied due to insufficient evidence meeting the
              exceptional ability criteria under U.S. immigration law.
            </p>
            <h2>Background of the Case</h2>
            <p>
              The petitioner, a general and operations manager in the
              manufacturing sector, lacked an advanced degree—one of the
              standard qualifications for the EB-2 visa category. Instead, they
              applied under the exceptional ability category, which requires
              meeting specific regulatory criteria. As an experienced
              immigration attorney in Indiana, I’ve seen how challenging it can
              be to qualify under exceptional ability without an advanced
              degree, which makes understanding and addressing the specific
              legal requirements essential.
            </p>
            <h2>Legal Framework for Exceptional Ability</h2>
            <p>
              Under U.S. immigration law, petitioners must meet at least three
              out of six criteria outlined in the regulations (8 C.F.R. §
              204.5(k)(3)(ii)) to qualify for exceptional ability:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>An academic degree related to the field.</li>
              <li>Ten years of full-time work experience.</li>
              <li>A license or certification in the field.</li>
              <li>A salary indicative of exceptional ability.</li>
              <li>Membership in professional associations.</li>
              <li>Recognition of significant achievements in the industry.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              While meeting three of these criteria is necessary, it doesn’t
              guarantee approval. A final merits determination assesses whether
              the petitioner’s expertise is “significantly above that ordinarily
              encountered” in the industry.
            </p>
            <h2>Case Analysis</h2>
            <p>
              In this case, the petitioner claimed to meet all six criteria.
              However, the Texas Service Center determined that only two
              criteria—related to work experience and salary—were met. The
              petitioner appealed, arguing that the remaining criteria were also
              satisfied, but the AAO upheld the denial based on several
              shortcomings.
            </p>
            <p>1. Academic Degree</p>
            <p>
              Petitioner’s Claim: The petitioner held a bachelor’s degree in
              aeronautical engineering, claiming it provided a strong foundation
              for their role in manufacturing management.
            </p>
            <p>
              AAO’s Finding: The AAO found the degree unrelated to the
              manufacturing industry, stating that aeronautics does not directly
              apply to manufacturing. The petitioner did not provide independent
              evidence demonstrating how the degree was relevant to their
              claimed area of exceptional ability.
            </p>
            <p>2. License or Certification</p>
            <p>
              Petitioner’s Claim: The petitioner presented a license to practice
              aeronautical engineering in Brazil.
            </p>
            <p>
              AAO’s Finding: The AAO agreed with the Director that a license was
              not relevant to the role of a general and operations manager in
              the manufacturing industry. This criterion was not satisfied.
            </p>
            <p>3. Membership in Professional Associations</p>
            <p>
              Petitioner’s Claim: Membership in the Brazilian Association of
              Asset Maintenance and Management (ABRAMAN) was submitted.
            </p>
            <p>
              AAO’s Finding: The AAO determined that ABRAMAN did not qualify as
              a professional association under U.S. regulations, as it did not
              consist exclusively of professionals holding a bachelor’s degree
              or higher.
            </p>
            <p>4. Recognition for Achievements</p>
            <p>
              Petitioner’s Claim: The petitioner submitted a book publication,
              participation in YouTube live streams, and letters of
              recommendation.
            </p>
            <p>
              AAO’s Finding: The evidence did not demonstrate significant
              contributions to the industry. The book publication and YouTube
              streams lacked evidence of widespread industry impact, such as
              citations or viewership metrics.
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              The AAO dismissed the appeal, stating that the petitioner did not
              satisfy the minimum of three criteria required for exceptional
              ability. Additionally, the petitioner failed to demonstrate that
              their expertise was “significantly above that ordinarily
              encountered” in the manufacturing industry. As a result, the AAO
              did not proceed to evaluate whether the petitioner merited a
              National Interest Waiver under the Matter of Dhanasar framework.
            </p>
            <h2>Significance for NIW Applicants</h2>
            <p>
              This case is a critical reminder for those applying for a National
              Interest Waiver based on exceptional ability. As an immigration
              attorney in Indiana, I often emphasize the importance of providing
              specific, objective, and relevant evidence to meet the exceptional
              ability criteria. It’s not enough to claim that skills or
              qualifications are transferable—there must be clear, documented
              proof that supports how they apply to the petitioner’s field of
              expertise. Furthermore, when claiming industry recognition, it’s
              vital to demonstrate that contributions are acknowledged beyond
              immediate circles and have had a significant impact on the
              industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              For those seeking an NIW without an advanced degree, it is
              essential to prepare a thorough and well-supported case. If you’re
              navigating the complexities of a National Interest Waiver and need
              expert guidance, I can help ensure your application meets the
              specific requirements of U.S. immigration law. Contact my office
              today to discuss your case and learn how we can build a strong
