            <h2>NIW/Proposed Endeavor</h2>
            <p>
              On July 25, 2024, the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) issued a
              decision regarding an appeal from a forensic accountant seeking a
              National Interest Waiver (NIW) under the EB-2 visa category. The
              petitioner, who operates an accounting firm specializing in
              international accounting and forensic tax services, aimed to prove
              that her work had substantial merit and national importance. The
              appeal was dismissed, offering valuable lessons for applicants. As
              an experienced immigration attorney in Indiana, I frequently work
              with clients on National Interest Waiver petitions, ensuring they
              meet the specific criteria required for approval.
            </p>
            <h2>Case Overview</h2>
            <p>
              The petitioner, an accountant, sought to waive the job offer
              requirement under the EB-2 classification. Her proposed endeavor
              involved providing forensic tax and accounting services with a
              focus on helping U.S. companies engage with the Latin American
              market. She argued that her expertise would enhance U.S.
              companies’ competitiveness, generate jobs, and contribute to the
              national economy.
            </p>
            <p>
              In her business plan, the petitioner projected substantial growth
              for her company, including job creation and foreign direct
              investment (FDI) attraction, particularly from Brazil. She also
              claimed that her endeavor would support U.S. national security by
              reducing dependency on Chinese supply chains through the
              relocation of critical resources to Latin America.
            </p>
            <h2>AAO Ruling</h2>
            <p>
              The AAO found that while the petitioner’s proposed endeavor had
              substantial merit, it did not meet the national importance
              requirement outlined in the Dhanasar framework. Although the
              petitioner provided detailed plans for growing her business, she
              failed to demonstrate how her work would have a broader impact on
              the U.S. economy or financial sectors beyond her direct clientele.
              Specifically, the AAO determined that her proposed work would not
              have significant national or global implications as required by
              the Dhanasar criteria.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ruling also noted that the petitioner did not provide
              sufficient evidence that her company’s projected growth would
              create enough jobs or generate enough economic benefit to satisfy
              the standard of “substantial positive economic effects” necessary
              to meet the national importance threshold. While the petitioner
              highlighted workforce shortages in accounting and financial
              services, the AAO emphasized that such issues are generally
              addressed through the Department of Labor's labor certification
              process, not through the National Interest Waiver pathway.
            </p>
            <h2>My Opinion as an Immigration Attorney in Indiana</h2>
            <p>
              As an immigration attorney specializing in National Interest
              Waiver petitions in Indiana, I believe this case highlights the
              importance of presenting a clearly defined, well-supported
              proposed endeavor. In this instance, the petitioner made general
              claims about the significance of her work but did not provide
              enough evidence to show how it would have a broader impact on U.S.
              industries or the national economy.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my practice, I emphasize the need for NIW applicants to clearly
              demonstrate how their work will have a substantial, positive
              effect on the U.S. economy, national security, or public welfare.
              Simply operating a successful business or addressing industry
              shortages isn’t enough—you must show how your work extends beyond
              your immediate field or clientele and contributes to broader
              national interests.
            </p>
            <p>
              While I am based in Indiana, I assist clients across the U.S. with
              NIW petitions and other immigration matters. I believe that with
              the right approach, many professionals in fields such as
              accounting, healthcare, and technology can successfully
              demonstrate the national importance of their work. However, this
              requires a strategic, detailed plan backed by solid evidence and
              expert testimonials.
            </p>
            <h2>Key Takeaways for National Interest Waiver Applicants</h2>
            <p>
              This case underscores the importance of presenting a detailed and
              compelling argument for how your proposed endeavor will impact the
              U.S. on a broader scale. As an immigration attorney in Indiana, I
              work closely with my clients to ensure that their petitions are
              well-prepared, with a clear focus on meeting the Dhanasar
              framework’s requirements. Whether you are working in finance,
              technology, or healthcare, your petition must go beyond general
              claims and demonstrate the substantial merit and national
              importance of your work.
            </p>
            <p>
