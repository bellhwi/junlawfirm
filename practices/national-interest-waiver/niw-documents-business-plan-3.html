            <h2>
              Case Commentary on the Importance of a Business Plan as Evidence
              in NIW Petitions
            </h2>
            <p>
              This is based on the AAO decision dated August 23, which is
              notable for providing detailed standards regarding business plans
              in NIW (National Interest Waiver) cases. The petitioner in this
              case was a civil engineering professional who submitted a business
              plan to demonstrate his contribution to the national interest.
              However, USCIS identified flaws in the plan and ultimately denied
              the petition. This case serves as a clear illustration of how the
              AAO evaluates business plans in NIW adjudications.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <h2>NIW Attorney’s Analysis and Commentary:</h2>
            <p>
              This case highlights several critical issues that petitioners must
              address with care when applying for a National Interest Waiver
              under the <em>Matter of Dhanasar</em> framework.
            </p>
            <h2>Substantial Merit and National Importance:</h2>
            <p>
              The AAO acknowledged that the proposed endeavor—providing
              logistics storage solutions in Florida—had intrinsic value.
              However, the petitioner failed to persuasively explain how the
              proposed business addressed a broader national-level problem.
              Although the petitioner aimed to expand statewide in Florida by
              2028, the lack of focus on national importance may have negatively
              impacted the case. In my NIW practice, I always advise clients to
              clearly articulate how their work aligns with national priorities
              such as addressing critical infrastructure needs, fostering
              technological innovation, or enhancing public safety.
            </p>
            <h2>Well-Positioned to Advance the Endeavor:</h2>
            <p>
              This is often the most challenging prong under the
              <em>Dhanasar</em> test. The AAO requires specific and verifiable
              evidence showing that the petitioner is well-positioned to carry
              out the proposed work. In this case, the AAO found that the
              petitioner’s business plan lacked sufficient detail, including a
              clear financial roadmap, staffing strategy, and operational
              expansion plans. From my experience, successful NIW petitions
              include solid evidence of the applicant’s unique qualifications,
              industry networks, and track record of success. Generic proposals
              are unlikely to persuade adjudicators.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the petitioner had warehouse construction experience in
              Colombia, the AAO concluded that this background did not
              effectively translate into a logistics consulting business in
              Florida. The key takeaway is that past experience must clearly
              support and align with future plans. For example, if the
              petitioner has engineering and construction experience, they must
              demonstrate how those skills directly contribute to success in
              logistics and consulting.
            </p>
            <h2>Lack of Demonstrated Interest from Clients and Investors:</h2>
            <p>
              One of the most important factors in proving “project feasibility”
              is showing tangible interest from stakeholders—clients, users, or
              investors. Although the petitioner submitted letters of interest
              from several companies, the AAO found them insufficient.
              Strategically, I always emphasize the importance of gathering
              strong stakeholder support in the form of contracts, letters of
              intent, or formal partnerships. Vague letters of interest alone do
              not convincingly establish a viable business path.
            </p>
            <h2>Importance of Specificity in the Business Plan:</h2>
            <p>
              A common shortcoming in NIW applications is the lack of detail in
              business plans or proposed endeavors. As an NIW expert, I
              recommend that petitioners present well-structured financial
              projections, a realistic timeline, and concrete market demand
              data. They must also explain how their work contributes to the
              logistics sector, particularly its impact on the U.S. economy,
              technology, or infrastructure.
            </p>
            <h2>Discretion and Balancing Test:</h2>
            <p>
              While the AAO did not address the third <em>Dhanasar</em> prong in
              this case (whether it is beneficial to the U.S. to waive the job
              offer and labor certification), it’s important to remember that
              this element is inherently discretionary. Even if the first two
              prongs are satisfied, the AAO can still deny the petition based on
              a discretionary assessment. Therefore, I advise petitioners to not
              only meet the legal standards but also persuasively demonstrate
              how their work aligns with national interests. This requires
              clearly linking the proposed endeavor to U.S. policy goals.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
            <p>
              In conclusion, this case illustrates how essential a strategic and
              detailed approach is to a successful NIW petition. While the
              proposed business may have had potential, the lack of specificity
              in the business plan, insufficient evidence of viability, and
              failure to demonstrate meaningful stakeholder interest led to its
              denial. As an attorney, I stress that NIW applicants must submit a
              well-structured case that thoroughly establishes their
              qualifications, business viability, and relevance to the U.S.
              national interest in order to maximize their chances of success.
