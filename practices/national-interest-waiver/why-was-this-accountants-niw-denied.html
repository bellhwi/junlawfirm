            </p>
            <h2>Why Was This Accountant's NIW Application Denied?</h2>
            <h3>NIW/Proposed Endeavor/CPA</h3>
            <p>
              The National Interest Waiver (NIW) is a category under U.S.
              immigration law that allows certain foreign nationals to waive the
              job offer and labor certification requirements if they can prove
              that their work benefits the national interest of the United
              States. However, to qualify for this waiver, applicants must meet
              three critical criteria. In this case, the accountant's NIW
              application was denied because he failed to sufficiently
              demonstrate one of these criteria: “national importance.” This
              article will analyze the reasons why his application was denied
              and discuss what could have been done to strengthen the case.
            </p>
            <h3>1. Background of the Accountant</h3>
            <p>
              The accountant in question is an Indian native and a Canadian
              citizen. He holds an MBA from a U.S. institution and is a licensed
              Certified Public Accountant (CPA) with over 20 years of
              experience. His proposed endeavor involved starting a consulting
              firm in the U.S. to offer accounting, tax, audit, and advisory
              services to small businesses, professionals, and self-employed
              individuals. While these services are certainly important on a
              personal level, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services
              (USCIS) determined that the accountant’s work did not rise to the
              level of national importance.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Why the NIW Application Was Denied</h3>
            <p>
              To qualify for an NIW, applicants must satisfy three key criteria:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The proposed endeavor must have “substantial merit” and
                  “national importance.”
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The applicant must be “well-positioned” to advance the
                  proposed work.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Granting the waiver must be beneficial to the United States.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              In this case, the accountant met the first criterion—his work was
              deemed to have "substantial merit." However, the application was
              denied because he did not provide sufficient evidence to prove the
              "national importance" of his proposed endeavor.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Lack of National Importance</h3>
            <p>
              USCIS raised concerns about whether a single accountant's services
              could have a substantial impact on the U.S. at a national level.
              The key reasons for the denial are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Limited Scope of Impact:</b> USCIS pointed out that “an
                  individual accountant is unlikely to have national or global
                  implications in the field.” While accounting services are
                  valuable to businesses and individuals, the accountant failed
                  to show how his work would have a broad national impact. He
                  claimed that his consulting firm would benefit small
                  businesses in the U.S., but did not provide concrete evidence
                  demonstrating how this would contribute to the national
                  economy on a larger scale. For an endeavor to be considered of
                  national importance, it must go beyond serving individual
                  clients and have the potential to significantly affect an
                  industry or field.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Lack of Specificity in the Business Plan:</b> The
                  accountant estimated that his business would require $120,000
                  to establish but did not provide detailed projections
                  regarding revenue, job creation, or how the business would
                  affect economically depressed areas. USCIS found the business
                  plan to be lacking in the specifics needed to evaluate whether
                  the business would have a substantial impact on the U.S.
                  economy.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Absence of Innovation:</b> To demonstrate national
                  importance, applicants must also show that their work will
                  lead to advancements or innovations within their field. In
                  this case, the accountant did not provide any evidence that
                  his proposed accounting services would bring about meaningful
                  improvements or innovations in the industry. USCIS typically
                  looks for evidence that an applicant’s work will lead to
                  advances that benefit society at large, not just individual
                  clients.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4. Suggestions for a Stronger NIW Application</h3>
            <p>
              To improve the chances of NIW approval, the accountant could have
              taken the following steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Stronger Evidence of National Importance:</b> While
                  accounting is a valuable service, the applicant needed to more
                  clearly demonstrate how his proposed business would impact the
                  U.S. economy or society at a national level. He could have
                  emphasized how his services would help create jobs in
                  underserved areas or assist small businesses in overcoming
                  economic challenges. More concrete and quantifiable data would
                  have been necessary to prove national importance.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Detailed Business Plan:</b> The accountant needed to
                  provide more detailed financial projections, including
                  expected revenue, the number of employees, and how his
                  business would contribute to local or national economic
                  growth. A more thorough business plan showing the scope of his
                  work would have given USCIS a clearer picture of how the
                  endeavor could impact the economy.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Emphasis on Innovation in the Field:</b> The accountant
                  could have strengthened his case by showing how his services
                  would introduce new methodologies or technologies in
                  accounting that could transform the field. For example, if his
                  consulting firm planned to implement cutting-edge tax software
                  or revolutionize accounting practices for small businesses,
                  this could have helped demonstrate national importance and
                  innovation.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              The main reason for the denial of this accountant’s NIW
              application was his inability to sufficiently prove that his
              proposed work had "national importance." While his services as a
              CPA are undoubtedly valuable on a personal and business level,
              USCIS requires applicants to demonstrate how their work will
              significantly benefit the United States as a whole. To succeed
              with an NIW application, it is crucial to not only highlight
              individual expertise but also to provide evidence of how that
              expertise will have a broader impact on the national economy or
              society​
